#Installation of Java
#Jenkins requires Java to run, yet not all Linux distributions include Java by default. Additionally, not all Java versions are compatible with Jenkins.

#There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

#Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 21, and check the installation with the commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre
java -version
#openjdk version "21.0.3" 2024-04-16
#OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.3+11-Debian-2)
#OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.3+11-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)

#You need to choose either the Jenkins Long Term Support release or the Jenkins weekly release.
#Long Term Support release
#A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the debian-stable apt repository.
